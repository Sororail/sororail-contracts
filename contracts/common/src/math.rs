//! Checked money math.
//!
//! Every operation here returns [`Error`] rather than wrapping, saturating or
//! panicking. Saturation is the dangerous default for balances: it silently
//! converts an overflow into a wrong-but-plausible number, and a payment
//! contract that reports a wrong balance is worse than one that refuses to act.
//!
//! # Basis-point math: single-consumer functions in a shared crate
//!
//! [`mul_bps`] and [`split_bps`] are currently used only by `escrow::resolve`,
//! but they live here rather than in `contracts/escrow/src/` for two reasons:
//!
//! 1. **Correctness by proximity**: The no-rounding-leakage invariant that
//!    `split_bps` provides is subtle and security-critical for dispute
//!    resolution. Keeping it alongside the other checked math makes that
//!    property visible in the shared test suite and documents it as a
//!    general-purpose building block, not an escrow implementation detail.
//!
//! 2. **Future reuse without duplication**: Any future contract that needs
//!    proportional splits (fee distribution, profit sharing, multi-party
//!    settlements) can use these immediately without rediscovering the
//!    remainder-by-subtraction pattern or reintroducing the tests.
//!
//! If no other contract adopts them by the time the codebase ships 1.0, we may
//! revisit this and move them into escrow. Until then, the cost of a few extra
//! lines in a shared crate is lower than the risk of reimplementing bps math
//! incorrectly in a future contract.
