//! Shared test-environment helpers for all SoroRail contract test suites.
//!
//! Gated behind the `testutils` feature so it is never compiled into
//! production or WASM builds. Each contract's `[dev-dependencies]` section
//! must include:
//!
//! ```toml
//! sororail-common = { workspace = true, features = ["testutils"] }
//! ```
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! [`TestEnv`] wraps an [`Env`] that has `mock_all_auths` enabled, with
//! convenience methods for the three things every fixture repeats:
//!
//! * creating a Stellar Asset Contract token (SAC) and minting an initial
//!   supply to a named funder,
//! * generating fresh [`Address`] values without repeating the
//!   `Address::generate(&env)` call everywhere, and
//! * advancing ledger time to a known timestamp.
//!
//! Per-contract `Fixture` structs register their own contracts and drive the
//! protocol — those stay in each test file because they are contract-specific.
//! Only the plumbing that is literally identical across all of them lives here.

// Test fixtures do plain arithmetic on known-small constants; the checked-math
// rule is for contract code.
