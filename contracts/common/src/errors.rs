use soroban_sdk::contracterror;

/// The single error enum shared by every SoroRail contract.
///
/// # Stability contract
///
/// These numbers are part of the public ABI. A client decodes an on-chain
/// failure by its integer, so **a released variant is never renumbered and
/// never removed**. Deprecate instead, and leave the number burned. The
/// `error_discriminants_match_the_published_abi_table` test in this crate
/// pins every discriminant so an accidental renumber fails CI.
///
/// New variants are appended inside the owning range. The ranges are:
///
/// | Range     | Owner          |
/// |-----------|----------------|
/// | 1–19      | generic        |
/// | 20–39     | `escrow`       |
/// | 40–59     | `stream`       |
/// | 60–79     | `vesting`      |
/// | 80–99     | `recurring`    |
/// | 100–119   | `batch_payout` |
///
/// Ranges are deliberately sparse so a contract can grow without colliding.
///
/// Not every contract returns every variant. Each contract's own `errors.rs`
/// carries a table of the variants it can raise and a "What is absent, and
/// why" section naming the shared variants it never returns -- keep both in
/// step when adding an error path to a contract.
///
/// # Generic errors that are currently single-contract
///
/// Some variants in the generic range (1–19) are currently used by only one
/// contract but remain generic to allow future reuse without ABI breakage:
///
/// - **`DeadlineNotReached` (11)** and **`DeadlinePassed` (12)**: Currently
///   only `escrow` uses these, but any future time-locked contract (e.g., a
///   vested airdrop, a time-based auction) would naturally reuse them. Keeping
///   them generic avoids having to add `EscrowDeadlineNotReached` now and a
///   separate `VestingDeadlineNotReached` later, fragmenting what is
///   conceptually the same failure mode.
///
/// - **`InvalidState` (10)** and **`InsufficientBalance` (13)**: Reserved for
///   lifecycle and balance checks that contracts currently handle with
///   contract-specific variants (e.g., `EscrowNotFunded`, `StreamCancelled`).
///   Every contract prefers a more specific error today, but these remain
///   available if a future contract's design benefits from a generic state or
///   balance check without needing a new numbered variant.
