/// The single error enum shared by every SoroRail contract.

/// # Stability contract
///
/// These numbers are part of the public ABI. A client decodes an on-chain
/// failure by its integer, so **a released variant is never renumbered and
/// never removed**. Deprecate instead, and leave the number burned. The
/// `error_discriminants_match_the_published_abi_table` test in this crate
/// pins every discriminant so an accidental renumber fails CI.
///
/// New variants are appended inside the owning range. The ranges are:
///
/// | Range     | Owner          |
/// |-----------|----------------|
/// | 1–19      | generic        |
/// | 20–39     | `escrow`       |
/// | 40–59     | `stream`       |
/// | 60–79     | `vesting`      |
/// | 80–99     | `recurring`    |
/// | 100–119   | `batch_payout` |
///
/// Ranges are deliberately sparse so a contract can grow without colliding.
