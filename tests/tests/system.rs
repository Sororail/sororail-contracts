//! Cross-contract integration tests.
//!
//! Each contract's own unit tests already prove it conserves value internally.
//! What they cannot see is the system: several SoroRail contracts holding the
//! same token at once, funded by the same account, unwinding in different
//! orders. These tests deploy real Stellar Asset Contract tokens and run full
//! lifecycles across all five contracts together.
//!
//! The invariant under test is the one that matters to an operator closing the
//! books: **no token is created or destroyed anywhere in the system.** Every
//! test ends by summing every balance — every party and every contract
//! address — and asserting it equals what was minted.
